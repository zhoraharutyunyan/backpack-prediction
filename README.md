# 🎒 Backpack Prediction Challenge (Playground Series S5E2)
Overview
This challenge is part of Kaggle’s "Tabular Playground Series"—a set of beginner-friendly competitions designed to help newcomers build practical machine-learning skills. In this episode, the task is to predict the weight of a backpack using a synthetic tabular dataset.

🎯 Objective
Forecast the continuous target value representing the backpack’s weight for each entry in the test set.

📥 Data Description
train.csv: Contains numerical and/or categorical features generated synthetically, along with the target—a floating-point value denoting the weight.

test.csv: Contains the same set of features but lacks the target.

Variations in data distribution exist between train and test sets, making generalization a key challenge.

🧮 Task Type & Evaluation
Problem type: Regression (predicting a real-valued quantity)

Evaluation metric: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between predicted and actual weights in the test set.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques
Your project can include an end-to-end pipeline featuring:

Languages/Libraries: Python with modules like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost

Typical steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering (e.g., grouping aggregations, interaction features, quantiles)

Handling missing values and scaling

Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

Model training (LightGBM/XGB)

Cross-validation (e.g. K-fold)

Ensemble or stacking techniques
